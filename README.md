# Mellat Loan Automation

Automation tool for requesting a **marriage loan** from **Bank Mellat**.

> âš  **Disclaimer**  
> This project is **customized for my personal use** and may not work out-of-the-box for everyone.  
> It is intended as a **demonstration** to share the idea of automating the loan request process.  
> You are welcome to use the existing code to accelerate your own customized version.

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Project Exists

At the time of creation, Bank Mellatâ€™s marriage loan applications were **limited in daily acceptance**.  
To increase the chances of securing a loan slot, I developed this project to **automatically send loan requests repeatedly** until one is accepted.

## ðŸ”‘ OTP Handling

The login process requires a **One-Time Password (OTP)** sent via SMS.  
To automate OTP handling, I used the **SMS Forwarder** app to send OTP messages directly to the automation API:

## âš™ How It Works

1. **Automated Login**
   - Uses forwarded OTP codes to bypass manual entry.
2. **Repeated Loan Request**
   - Continuously sends marriage loan requests until acceptance.

3. **Custom Configuration**
   - Adapt the script to your own login details and timing preferences.

- This project **is not officially supported** by Bank Mellat.
- Use responsibly and at your own risk.
